      <p>
        I am a curious person. I find so many things interesting and like to learn about all of them.
        I have dabbled in calligraphy, cardistry, and gardening. I enjoy games of all types: video games, board games,
        card games, and all other sorts of tabletop RPGs.
        I enjoy working on the front end portion of applications. Being able
        to see your work and creating a great user experience is satisfying to me.
        I like both working alone and with a team, I think there is a time and place for both. Most of my experience
        is with ReactJS/Redux, C#/.NET and some TSQL. I am willing to learn any language
        and am able to adapt quickly.
